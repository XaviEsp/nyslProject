                    <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's Northside neighborhoods, who have an interest in
                        learning and playing soccer, specifically those skills around team cooperation and good
                        sportsmanship.</p>
                    <h1>Vision</h1>
                    <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful athletes

                    <h1>General information</h1>
                    <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in
                        Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in wich to learn and play soccer. To be a
                        member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside
                        neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time
                        of parents and previous league members.</p>
